The listed parameters are retrieved with a number of methods, the more complex two of which is rcvSeat and rcvInquiry

#####rcvSeat
This method receives the following data:
* seat
* mySeat
* nPlyr
* startStates
seat is received in [1 ~ n-1, 0] order so as to ensure [SB# ~ DEALER#] order.
mySeat is received within the iterations
nPlyr and startStates are initialized for the first round decision of pre-flop bet (DEAL_BET)

#####rcvInquiry

* nPlyr
* myState
* rdRecords

nPlyr is updated using rdRecords
myState can be updated with rdstate[last]
rdRecords is harder to maintain
