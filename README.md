SHREWD is a Texas Hold'em Poker AI agent, designed for 2015 Huawei Software Elite Challenge. It follows a protocol to communicate with the game server and competes with other agents in the game. 

After the Huawei competition, the project has now become a personal toy project. 

## The Name
> 视其所以，观其所由，察其所安。人焉廋哉，人焉廋哉？

> ——孔子

A shrewd player can always see through his opponent's motives and make his best move. So he will always play with his best hand and therefor be the last one on the table. It is like Confucius said, "Observe his behaviour, detect his strategy and find his tell. How can one hide? How can one hide! "

## Current Progress
The communication subsystem has been refactored and the artificial intelligence part is yet to be developed.
