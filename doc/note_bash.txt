##Command Substitution and Pipelines
* Pipelines redirect input as file inputs
* Command substitution view outputs as command literals

##Parameter Expansion
##Brace Expansion
* {1..100..4} like a for loop that produce a list
* {1..5}{0,5}% like a double for loop where the second is a foreach
