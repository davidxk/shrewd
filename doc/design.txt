##System Design
###Communication System
####Message parsing
* Scanner analyzes pieces of message (mostly on a line-wise bases), converting linear string to data structures
* Parser parses complete messages, passing data to the Player
* Parser uses a Scanner

####Data maintenance
* Player receives data in ways it sees fit and maintain its integrity
* PlayerWithTools provides a set of methods for easy access to the data
* PlayerWithTools is a Player

####Controlling
* Controller sits on top of Player and Parser and manages the whole process

######*Coupling*
* A parser should not use a player. Yet for the time being, let it be 
* Use STL Map to return pid nut_hand the like
