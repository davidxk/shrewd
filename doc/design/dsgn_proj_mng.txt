After adding:
* Project layout design
* Makefile cleaning
* Design before coding
* Tests
* Code generation tools
* C++ coding style

Into the project, I think there are more element of managing a larger project that I can add to shrewd. And these are useful techniques to learn. 

√ Unified test cases
√ GDB debugging techniques
  Shell script for job automation
  Jenkins for continous integration
  Doxygen for document generation

And improve the quality of the implementation of the elements already added. 

Layout: write auto gen tools to re-build and manage the project
Makefile: write it with better structure and with better practice
Design: better coding style and follow OOP design guideline
Tests: learn how to write test cases
Codegen: look for project that I can use as-is
Style: write auto tools to gen and check codes.
