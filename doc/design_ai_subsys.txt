There could be several sub-systems to ai system. 
* Round analysers
* Common card analysers
* My hand analyser
* Decision maker

The problem is complex. I have to make resonable assumptions to make it simple. 
I assume the following in this version:
* All opponents are rational, makes good judgement and makes the right move
* There is no need to differenciate opponents as they play only the right move
* The opponents never change their strategy
* No opponent bluffs

One sub-system that I find easier to start with is PFlopRdAlysr. It analyzes the card power of the opponent through their moves, with respect to their seat, jetton info and the number of players at the table.  
+ Calling big blind is considered week. 
+ Opening is considered relatively strong. Ranging from 3 bet to 5 bet. 
+ Calling an openning is considered stronger than opening but not very strong. 
+ Re-Raise is considered very strong. Ranging from 3 bet to 5 bet, till all-in 
+ Calling a high re-raise is considered as strong as the re-raise itself possibly stronger

Strong means the combination of the three: big hole card set, good seat position or large jetton base. Of the three, the first is the most influential factor(or it will be called bluffing which presumably dosen't happen).
