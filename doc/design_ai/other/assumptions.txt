##Simplifying Assumptions
> The problem is complex. I have to make resonable assumptions to simplify the problem to for easier modelling. 

The following are assumed in this version:

* All opponents are rational, makes good judgement and makes the right move
* There is no need to differenciate opponents as they play only the right move
* The opponents never change their strategy
* No opponent bluffs
