The following is based on my own presumption

+ Calling big blind is considered week. 
+ Opening is considered relatively strong. Ranging from 3 bet to 5 bet. 
+ Calling an openning is considered stronger than opening but not very strong. 
+ Re-Raise is considered very strong. Ranging from 3 bet to 5 bet, till all-in 
+ Calling a high re-raise is considered as strong as the re-raise itself possibly stronger

Strong means the combination of the three: big hole card set, good seat position or large jetton base. Of the three, the first is the most influential factor(or it will be called bluffing which presumably dosen't happen).
