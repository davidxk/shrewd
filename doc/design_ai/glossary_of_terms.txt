####Loose Game
Players in the game tend to play loosely: play relatively more hands and tend to continue with weaker hands. 
> * Bluffs and semi-bluffs are less effective because loose opponents are less likely to fold.
> * Requirements for continuing with made hands may be lower because loose players may also be playing lower value hands.
> * Drawing to incomplete hands, like flushes, tends to be more valuable as draws will often get favorable pot odds
