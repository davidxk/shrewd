##Strategies
####Loose Player
Loose players play relatively more hands and tend to continue with weaker hands; hence they do not often fold.

####Tight Player
Tight players play relatively fewer hands and tend not to continue with weaker hands; hence they often fold.

####Loose Game
Players in the game tend to play loosely: play relatively more hands and tend to continue with weaker hands. 
> * Bluffs and semi-bluffs are less effective because loose opponents are less likely to fold.
> * Requirements for continuing with made hands may be lower because loose players may also be playing lower value hands.
> * Drawing to incomplete hands, like flushes, tends to be more valuable as draws will often get favorable pot odds

####Trips

####Inside Draw
An inside straight draw, or gutshot draw, is a hand with four of the five cards needed for a straight, but missing one in the middle. For example, 9-x-7-6-5. An inside straight draw has four outs. Because straight draws including an ace only have four outs, they are also considered inside straight draws.
