To reach a reasonable decision on the moves to make, the ai system need to do the following:
* understand the probabilities
* understand the opponents' move
* make a decision on what move to make

Thus, there could be several sub-systems to this ai system. 
* Round analysers
* Common card analysers
* My hand analyser
* Decision maker

One sub-system that I find easier to start with is PFlopRdAlysr. It analyzes the card power of the opponent through their moves, with respect to their seat, jetton info and the number of players at the table.
