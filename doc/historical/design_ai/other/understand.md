##Three Hand Type
1. The goal of a Top Pair in pre-flop is to drive the free riders away and leave as few people into flop round as possible. 
2. The goal of a Speculative Hand in pre-flop is to limp into pre-flop as cheap as possible and with as many opponents as possible. 
3. The goal of a Powerhouse in pre-flop is to make money. If the game is tight, raise no more than a Top Pair to invite players entering the game. If the game is loose, re-raise all the way to all-in. Make sure your opponents enter with money and unpromising expectations.
