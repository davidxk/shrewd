##Before 1st Re-org
The project is previously divided into 4 directories. Source contains all source code. Libs is not used. Makeproject contains the object files and makefile. Target contains the single executable file. 

Now there is little doubt that further dividing the source into different directories is a good idea. With model containing the protocol-dependent classes, comm containing the communication subsystem, data containing the data maintenance subsystem and ai comprising the AI subsystem. 

The question now is where to put the test projects. A key point to this problem is the way of writing makefiles. It is desirable that objects should be gathered in the same directory. 

There is little doubt, that the 4 directories will not be enough. At least a doc and a tools directory are needed. 

##Before rejecting autotools
Now that the re-ogr has been done, it seems to be the time to sort out the messy makefiles. It seems 'autotools' can be used to address to this problem. A few tools that keeps popping up are: GNU automake & autoconf, cmake and scons. Cmake seems the best solution, while scons is also commercially used and GNU series is something that's always worth mentioning. 

Makefile is most troublesome to maintain. Autotools may well be the ending solution to this problem, which has been there for ever too long.
