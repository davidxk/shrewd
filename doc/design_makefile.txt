##Basic Structure
There are two major targets. One is a the client, the other is the test or tests. 

##Elaboration
Prerequisite can be obtained with -MD option of the compiler. Actions to be taken can be generated with the implicit rules. Generic rules can be defined for the targets. 
The basic idea is to start from the basis of what we have and try to make the makefiles shorter in length and rules more general. 
Before we begin, however, it is good practice to first experiment it on learn_make. 

##Requirements
1. Output to specified directory
	  * obj file to build 
2. Include from different directory
	√ * include from model/ comm/ data/ ai/
	√ * include from both source/ and tests/
3. Automate the process
	  * generate template for two Makefile.am file
