Learn to put the tests into one project. 

##Tests Now
* testClassName.cpp
* A cpp file with a main() 
* Main() initiate the actions in the same thread 
* Multiple projects
* print out the output

##Cocos Tests
* ClassNameTest.h 
* A class with a onEnter() 
* Controller initiate the actions on a separate thread and checks 
* Single project with TestCase bundled as TestSuite
* Assert the output

##Model
* A TestCase knows the information about itself
* A TestCase knows how to run itself
* A TestCase tests all functions of a Class
* A TestSuite holds an array of TestCases
* A TestSuite holds an array of TestSuite sons
* A TestSuite can automatically run the array of TestCases it holds 
* A TestSuite contains an array of TestCases or TestSuite for a sub-system
* A TestController can run a tree of TestSuite automatically 
* A TestController is called for whenever a sub-system is modified

* Each Class has a TestCase
* Each directory has a TestSuite

TestCase::
onEnter();
string testName;

TreeNode::
addChild();
children;
parent;

TestSuite::
addTestCase();	//add a TestCase to testCaseList
runTestSuite();	//run the TestCase in testCaseList
testCaseList;	//data

RootTest:TestSuite
RootTest()	//addTestSuite here

TestControl::
runAutoTest();	//run TestTree
stopAutoTest();	//
//pauseAutoTest();
